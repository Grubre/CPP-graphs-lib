# GraphsCPPLib
The library contains a template graph model class.

### The current functionality includes:
* template values for nodes and vertices
* basic functions and operator overloads for adding and modifying nodes and vertices
* traversal algorithms (dfs, bfs) with support for custom functions
* keeping track of the graph proprties, namely checking whether the graph is cyclic, connected and directed
* counting the number of paths of certain length between two nodes,
* finding the shortest path between two nodes
